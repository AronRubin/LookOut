LookOut for Seamonkey
=====================

Since Seamonkey 2.0 the Add-on LookOut doesn't work. The main aim of this project is to fix this problem, since the TNEF coded attachments can't be opened and saved.

This repo is forked from the [LookOut Thunderbird Add-on](https://github.com/AronRubin/LookOut) of Aron Rubin.
